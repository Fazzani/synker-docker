# Example alertmanager.yml configuration
#
# See https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/ for Alertmanager configuration syntax and built-in receivers.
# Currently, these include email, HipChat, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Slack, VictorOps, and WeChat.

# If you need to send to a target that isn't built into Alertmanager, consider configuring a webhook_config below and
# using an online service such as [built.io](https://built.io) or instead running a bot container to receive
# and relay alerts. swarmstack provides an Errbot Docker image for this purpose, which currently also supports Cisco
# Webex Teams, IRC, Telegram Messenger, and XMPP/Jabber services such as Google Hangouts (talk.google.com).
#
# Other backends, such CampFire, Discord, Gitter, Matrix, Mattermost, Matrix, Microsoft Bot Framework, Skype, Tox, VK,
# and Zulip and others are supported through the Errbot community. If you want to run a bot to relay alerts, see:
